# Regression--Prediciton-of-Grocery-Sales

This project was an examination of the data given in a grocery store sales analysis. This data was taken from several types of stores in different locations. It ranged from fruits and vegetables to meats to dairy products, which is the type of items sold in a grocery store.

2 relevant insights are that the groceries can be sold at a 59% model and the store will need to keep their products relevant for the customers to see.

The model that I would recommend to use would be the Decision Tree model because it will look at al the data through various metrics and show how productive the store can be.
