# Regression--Prediciton-of-Grocery-Sales

This project was an examination of the data given in a grocery store sales analysis. This data was taken from ten different types of stores in different locations.  This dataset showed the weight and details of the food and various items in the grocery stores, along with the type of items that they were, for example, whether they were dairy or meat products or soft drinks.  It ran the gambelt of a typical grocery store and therefore was a good cross section of what to expect when walking into a store like this.

There was also information given about the stores themselves.  This showed the year the store was established, its size, location, and type of store that it was.  That could influence how and what groceries are sold. For example, if a store is just opening in a new market, it may have to compete with other store with similar grocieries or products.  If it is an established store in a well established neighborhood, it could have customers who know and recommend the store.

The predicition this model used was that it was $738 off from the true value per year. While that is not in the thousands of dollars, it is not a massive loss throughout the year within the 10 stores.  I would recommend using the Decision Tree Model with the Mean Absolute Error tuned as an example of how to get this infromation for all the stores.
